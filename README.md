# project template

This is the README for the develop branch. See the [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) for details of how to branch from this for development work.

This is a template for practable remote lab projects. 

Each project should include a general description here of the remote lab: what is the hardware in general how and where it is used and any associated resources or publications. For example, from spinner-amax:

```
Spinner experiment with Maxxon AMAX 32 motor, upgraded for 2022 usage by Controls and Instrumentation 3, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh. This design has now been used for over 2,500 hours in total across 12 separate instances. We have now expanded the fleet to 48 experiments, with 12 different weights (four of each).

You can cite the contents of this repo via this paper:

If you are interested in adopting or designing a new remote laboratory based on this, or any, practable remote lab then please contact: ....

# Contents

Each project should then list the contents of the repo with links to associated README.md files for each component e.g.:

- [fw](./fw/README.md)
- [hw](./hw/README.md)
- [ui](./ui/README.md)
- [sbc](./sbc/README.md)

# Activities

Describe possible activities that can be performed with this remote laboratory. This may include example activities for demonstrations or activities that connect with known learning objectives in undergraduate or secondary school courses.

# Versions

A section should describe the release versions, e.g.:

- v1.2.0: updated css style
- v1.1.0: bug fix on graph tool
- v1.0.0: first release version of spinner remote lab
